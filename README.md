# Churn-Prediction

This is a simple project to demonstrate that customer 'churn' (churn here refers to whether the customer will continue with same service provider or will discontinue)
can be predicted using information already available to the company in the form of features and services availed by the customer as well as the billing 
information of said customer. Examples of such information are whether the customer utilises the  services of online backup, online security, streaming TV, tech support, etc.
